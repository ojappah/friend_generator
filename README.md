# FriendGenerator
Welcome to my Friend Generator Application.

This is a simple CLI application that allows a user to create a new instance of a Friend. The user have an option to choose a male, female or a random friend. Each friend is create based of the user input. Once friends are created, the user can call 'friends' to see a listing of all the user friends and also get more details on each friend.

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'friend_generator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install friend_generator

## Usage
